## Situation
Unqork introduced a new feature that allowed experienced JavaScript developers to create their own components for use in the **Module Builder** tool. The feature expanded customization options for enterprise clients but required clear conceptual documentation to help developers understand how to integrate it effectively.

---

## Task
As the technical writer, I was responsible for researching, designing, and publishing a conceptual “How To” article introducing the new **Bring Your Own Task List** feature. The goal was to provide developers with accurate, end-to-end guidance while reducing reliance on internal support teams.

---

## Action
- **Research:** Evaluated and compiled internal and external documentation.  
- **Development:** Created layout, design, styling, and instructional language in MadCap Flare.  
- **Collaboration:** Partnered with a product manager and two engineers to ensure technical accuracy.  
- **Implementation:** Uploaded, cross-linked, and promoted the article on the Unqork Doc Hub.  

---

## Result
- Delivered documentation supporting a new Unqork platform feature to over **1,000 end-users**.  
- Improved developer onboarding and self-service capabilities.  
- Reduced workload for customer support and support engineers.
