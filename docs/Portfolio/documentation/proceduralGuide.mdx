## Situation
The **Unqork platform** allows users to build complex business logic using the **Data Workflow Component**, a tool for visual data manipulation. Among its many operators, the **Get Operator** enables users to select and retrieve a single field’s value from a dataset. Because this operation is essential for developers configuring data logic, Unqork needed a concise procedural guide to walk users through proper setup and use.

---

## Task
As the technical writer, I was responsible for creating a clear and accessible **procedural guide** for the Get Operator. The documentation needed to help platform users understand its purpose, configuration options, and real-world use cases—without requiring them to read source code or rely on support engineers.

---

## Action
- **Research:** Reviewed internal engineering notes, platform release information, and existing Data Workflow documentation.  
- **Development:** Authored a step-by-step guide with detailed UI visuals, structured examples, and consistent styling within **MadCap Flare**.  
- **Collaboration:** Worked with the product manager and two engineers to validate procedure accuracy and ensure technical completeness.  
- **Implementation:** Published and cross-linked the article within the Unqork Doc Hub to improve content discoverability and user adoption.  

---

## Result
- Produced a **procedural guide** that helped over **1,000 Unqork users** correctly implement the Get Operator.  
- Simplified complex data workflows into approachable documentation for no-code developers.  
- Reduced support tickets related to operator configuration, easing workloads for engineering and customer support teams.
