## Situation
Unqork needed a centralized, scalable, and user-friendly documentation hub to support developers, clients, and internal teams using the platform. The previous documentation approach lacked consistency, searchability, and accessibility, leading to an increased volume of support requests and slower onboarding for new users.

---

## Task
As the lead technical writer, I was responsible for **designing, implementing, and authoring** the public-facing documentation website. The goal was to create a unified and intuitive experience that reflected Unqork’s brand, improved content discoverability, and served as a reliable resource for both internal and external audiences.

---

## Action
- **Site Design & Layout:** Built a responsive and accessible documentation site in **MadCap Flare**, focusing on clean information architecture, visual hierarchy, and intuitive navigation.  
- **Implementation:** Configured versioning, custom templates, and CI/CD publishing workflows using Git for continuous updates.  
- **Content Strategy & Language:** Established tone, style, and taxonomy for the docs. Authored task-based, user-centric content including onboarding guides, reference materials, and API documentation.  
- **Collaboration:** Partnered with product managers, engineers, and UX designers to ensure documentation accurately reflected platform behavior and real-world use cases.  

---

## Result
- Reduced **average clicks to content** from six to four, simplifying navigation and improving user flow.  
- Increased **user engagement**, with time-on-page up by ~45%.  
- Boosted **organic search traffic** by ~650% through improved content structure and metadata.  
- Delivered a scalable documentation framework that empowered cross-team contributions and supported Unqork’s growing product suite.
