## Situation
Unqork’s increased focus on **accessibility compliance** created a need for clear documentation on **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** settings and their implementation. Developers and designers needed concise reference materials to ensure Unqork applications met accessibility standards.

---

## Task
As the technical writer, I was tasked with developing a comprehensive **reference guide** explaining ARIA roles, attributes, and implementation guidelines for Unqork’s no-code environment. The document needed to serve as a quick-access resource for platform users while aligning with accessibility best practices.

## Action
- **Research:** Evaluated and synthesized internal development notes and external accessibility documentation (WAI-ARIA standards).  
- **Development:** Designed and authored the guide in **MadCap Flare**, focusing on clarity, consistent terminology, and accessible structure.  
- **Collaboration:** Partnered with a product manager and two engineers to verify technical accuracy and ensure examples reflected the platform’s UI.  
- **Implementation:** Published the article on the Unqork Doc Hub, with cross-links to related accessibility and component documentation.  

---

## Result
- Delivered a **centralized ARIA reference guide** used by over **1,000 Unqork platform users**.  
- Improved awareness and consistency in accessibility implementations acr
