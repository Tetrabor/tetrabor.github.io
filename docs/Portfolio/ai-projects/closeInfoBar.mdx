**Project Type:** Site Project
**Target Audience:** All users of the Unqork Document Hub.
**Platform:** [Unqork](https://unqork.com/) — a SaaS no-code application platform for financial technology companies.
**AI Tool:** Gemini Pro AI (https://gemini.google.com/)
**Example Link:** [View Example Link→](https://docs.unqork.io/docs/7300-platform-release-notes)

## Situation
Unqork clients need to be kept informed about major changes to software releases or documentation. Their knowledge management platform, Doc360, offers Info Bars that display at the top of a page on the Document Hub. However, those bars can’t be closed, and take up space after the information has been ingested.

---

## Task
As the resident lead technical writer, I was asked if I could create a way for readers to acknowledge an info bar, and temporarily remove it from view.

---

## Action
- **Research:** Conferred with Gemini Pro AI on the best approach and compatibility with Doc360 software.
- **Development:** Generated JavaScript code that allows readers to close an info bar by clicking a button labeled “X”. Their decision is saved for up to 30 days, preventing excess information from displaying on the page. Whenever new info is posted, the bar reappears.
- **Collaboration:** Worked with the technical writer manager to ensure compatibility with Doc360.
- **Implementation:** Implemented the JavaScript in Doc360’s code section.

---

## Result
- Documentation users can now hide info bars they no longer want to see.
- Improved document scannability.
- Simplified document structure.

### 💡 Key Takeaways
This project demonstrates proficiency with using AI to code robust features into an existing documentation platform.
