**Project Type:** Site Project  
**Target Audience:** All users of the Unqork Document Hub.  
**Platform:** [Unqork](https://unqork.com/) — a SaaS no-code application platform for financial technology companies.  
**AI Tool:** [Gemini Pro AI](https://gemini.google.com/)  
**Example Link:** [View Example Link→](https://docs.unqork.io/docs/text-field-component?highlight=Disable%20User%20Input&block=mfwji7zi-eb5rm5-055&tab=7bf086e9-5eec-49f5-9888-346bdbf88a8e)

## Situation
Because of the Unqork platform’s complexity, clients and stakeholders needed a way to directly link to settings and passages in the help documentation. The chosen documentation platform (Doc360), did not provide an option for precise text linking.

---

## Task
As the resident technical writer, I was asked by stakeholders to research or develop a way around the documentation website’s limitations.

---

## Action
- **Research:** Reviewed methods used by leading services, crafted an implementation methodology using Gemini Pro AI.
- **Development:** Used AI to build and refine a Javascript file that utilizes the browser highlight function and the documentation platform’s AngularJS to create hyperlinks to anywhere in a document’s text.
- **Collaboration:** Worked with a project manager and technical writing manager to refine the implementation.
- **Implementation:** Implemented the JavaScript in Doc360’s code section.

---

## Result
- Documentation users can now highlight any text in a document and create a link to share.
- Improved feedback loops from SMEs and Community participants.
- Simplified Marketing and Customer Support’s linking methods for clients.

### 💡 Key Takeaways
This project demonstrates proficiency with using AI to code in robust features to an existing documentation platform.
