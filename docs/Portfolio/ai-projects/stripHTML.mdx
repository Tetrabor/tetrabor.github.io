# AI Project - Python Element Stripper

**Project Type:** Site Project
**Target Audience:** All users of the Unqork Training Academy
**Platform:** [Unqork](https://unqork.com/) — a SaaS no-code application platform for financial technology companies.
**AI Tool:** Gemini Pro AI (https://gemini.google.com/)
**Example Link:** Internal Access Only

---

## Situation
Unqork’s enablement department recently migrated to a new knowledge management program. The program promised they would be able to export documents, and upload them to their training academy website. However, those exported documents also included unwanted HTML elements, like a header and a table of contents (TOC). These elements conflicted with the training academy’s existing TOC and headers.

---

## Task
As the lead technical writer, I was asked to find a way to remove (strip) the TOC and header elements from the HTML.

---

## Action
- **Research:** Evaluated possible methods with Gemini AI.
- **Development:** Used AI to generate a Python script that stripped the specified HTML elements, added additional CSS and validation checks to make up for limited access to software libraries.
- **Collaboration:** Applied feedback provided by managers of the Enablement and Technical Writing departments.
- **Implementation:** Worked with Unqork’s Enablement department to train and integrate the python script into their upload routines.

---

## Result
- Unqork Enablement employees can now upload Doc360 documents to their training academy platform.
- Employees no longer manually remove the TOC and header elements from an .htm file.
- Document integration between platforms is ~30% faster.
